When finishing tasks from the developmentPlan, only always finish one item in the list never multiple. 
Always ask if we should continue with the next task in the end.
Always check off finished tasks from the developmentPlan.

When I ask you to fix a specific bug, only fix this but don't do other things in the same file at that time!
