# AI Spend Tracker – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

**AI Spend Tracker** is a lightweight, browser-based dashboard for solo builders and early-stage AI startups to consolidate and visualize all their AI-API and SaaS tool expenses in one place. By connecting billing feeds or uploading invoices/CSV files, users get instant clarity on how much they’re spending, where it’s going, and whether they’re staying within budget—without jumping between multiple vendor portals or wrestling with spreadsheets.

## 2. Business Objectives

1. **Rapid Setup & Visibility**  
   Enable users to see their AI and SaaS spend in minutes—no lengthy integrations or onboarding calls.
2. **Expense Clarity & Control**  
   Break down spend by tool, by project, and over time so users can quickly identify cost spikes or under-utilized subscriptions.
3. **Actionable Budgeting**  
   Provide simple alerts and forecast charts to help builders set and stay within monthly or project-level budgets.
4. **Validation for Expansion**  
   Test core value-proposition with a minimal feature set to validate demand before investing in advanced analytics or enterprise features.

## 3. User Personas

### “Solo AI Hacker”

- **Profile**: A solo developer or small team building AI-powered side-projects or early-stage startups.
- **Tech Comfort**: Very high—lives in code editors, APIs, and the terminal. Low tolerance for manual financial work.
- **Pain Points**:
  - “I have ten different API keys and billing portals—I never know how much I’ll be charged next month.”
  - “My prototype got costly overnight and I only realized when my credit card bill hit.”
  - “I want to know which model calls are draining my budget.”

### “Bootstrap Founder”

- **Profile**: Founder of a 2–10-person AI startup, juggling product build, fundraising, and burn-rate management.
- **Tech Comfort**: High—comfortable with SaaS but expects polished UI/UX and simple workflows.
- **Pain Points**:
  - “I need to forecast runway but our AI costs fluctuate wildly.”
  - “I wish I could tie API usage back to specific features or clients.”
  - “I don’t want to build a financial dashboard myself.”

## 4. MVP Feature Set

1. **Billing Feed Connections**
   - Connect to major AI billing APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) via API keys.
   - Link Stripe or generic SaaS portals via read-only tokens or manual CSV export.
2. **Manual Upload & Parsing**
   - Accept CSV/JSON invoice exports for any tool not directly supported.
   - Auto-detect date, amount, vendor, and description fields.
3. **Expense Categorization**
   - Auto-classify by vendor and API (e.g., “OpenAI – GPT-4”), with manual overrides.
   - Allow custom tags (e.g., “Project Alpha,” “Chatbot Feature”).
4. **Dashboard & Visuals**
   - Summary tiles: Total spend this month, spend last month, spend change (%).
   - Line chart: cumulative spend over time.
   - Bar/pie chart: spend by tool or by project tag.
5. **Budgeting & Alerts**
   - Let users set simple monthly or per-project spend caps.
   - Trigger email or in-app notices at 75% and 100% of budget.
6. **Data Export & API**
   - Export spend data as CSV.
   - Expose a read-only JSON API endpoint for integration into other dashboards or Slack bots.

## 5. Data & Integration

- **Supported Inputs**
  - **Direct API**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Stripe (for SaaS billing).
  - **Uploads**: CSV and JSON invoice exports from any provider.
- **Parsing Logic**
  - Normalize date (ISO 8601), vendor, description, amount (USD by default).
  - Heuristics to detect line-item charges vs. lump-sum invoices.
- **Storage**
  - Per-user data isolation in a multi-tenant database.
  - Encrypt all sensitive fields at rest (AES-256).

---

## 6. Key Metrics & Reporting

- **Total Spend** = ∑(all charges)
- **Spend by Tool** = ∑(charges grouped by vendor/API)
- **Spend by Project** = ∑(charges grouped by custom tag)
- **Month-over-Month Change** = (This month – Last month) ÷ Last month × 100
- **Burn Forecast** = (Current month’s daily average × days remaining) + realized charges
- **Budget Utilization** = Current spend ÷ User-defined budget × 100

Visual reports will be interactive, with hover-tooltips and drill-downs by time range or tag.

---

## 7. Platform & Access

- **Delivery**: Web SaaS (no mobile apps).
- **Browsers**: Supported on latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- **Authentication**: Email/password signup (via Auth0 or equivalent), optional OAuth with GitHub/Google for faster onboarding.
- **User Accounts**: Single-user scope for MVP; no team or role management initially.

---

## 8. Security & Compliance

- **Transport Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for all in-transit data.
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for all stored billing data.
- **Access Control**: JWT-based sessions, per-user data isolation.
- **Privacy**: No data sharing with third parties; clear data-deletion flow.
- **Compliance**: Basic SOC-type controls; no formal audit for MVP.

---

## 9. Out of Scope (MVP)

- **Team Accounts & Permissions**
- **Mobile Applications (iOS/Android)**
- **Advanced Analytics** (e.g., ROI per model call, anomaly detection)
- **Direct Bank API Integrations** (Plaid, etc.)
- **Full Invoice Payment** (bill pay, credit card management)
- **Custom Branding or White-Labeling**

---

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Wireframes & User Flow**
   - Sketch core screens: onboarding, connections, dashboard, settings.
2. **Proof-of-Concept Integrations**
   - Prototype OpenAI billing ingestion and CSV parser.
3. **Data Model & Backend**
   - Design tables for charges, vendors, users, budgets, and tags.
4. **Front-end MVP**
   - Build React/Vue components for summary tiles and charts.
5. **Alpha Release & Feedback**
   - Recruit 5–10 solo builders for early feedback; iterate on pain points.
6. **Refine & Launch Beta**
   - Harden error handling, add email alerts, polish UI, then open to a wider beta.
